## Install KeyCloak SSO on Ubuntu 20.04

``` bash
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y
```
Keycloak is a Java based application. So Java JDK must be installed on your server. If not installed, you can install it using the following command:

``` bash
apt-get install default-jdk -y
```
Once Java is installed, you can verify the Java version using the following command:

``` bash
java --version
```
Next, you will need to download the latest version of Keycloak from the GitHub website. You can use the wget command to download it to your system.

``` bash
wget https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/download/15.0.2/keycloak-15.0.2.tar.gz
```

Once the download is completed, extract the downloaded file with the following command:

```bash
tar -xvzf keycloak-15.0.2.tar.gz
```
Next, move the extracted directory to the /opt with the following command:

```bash
mv keycloak-15.0.2 /opt/keycloak
```
Next, create a dedicated user and group for Keycloak with the following command:

```bash
groupadd keycloak

useradd -r -g keycloak -d /opt/keycloak -s /sbin/nologin keycloak
```
Next, set the ownership of the /opt/keycloak directory to keycloak:

```bash
chown -R keycloak: /opt/keycloak

chmod o+x /opt/keycloak/bin/
```
### Configure Keycloak

Next, you will need to create a Keycloak configuration directory and copy the sample configuration file. You can create it inside the /etc directory:

```bash
mkdir /etc/keycloak
```
Next, copy the sample configuration files from the /opt/keycloak directory using the following command:

```bash
cp /opt/keycloak/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.conf /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf 

cp /opt/keycloak/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/launch.sh /opt/keycloak/bin/
```
Next, set proper ownership using the following command:
```bash
chown keycloak: /opt/keycloak/bin/launch.sh
```
Next, edit the launch.sh file and define your Keycloak path:

```bash
vi /opt/keycloak/bin/launch.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "x$WILDFLY_HOME" = "x" ]; then
    WILDFLY_HOME="/opt/keycloak"
fi

if [[ "$1" == "domain" ]]; then
    $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/domain.sh -c $2 -b $3
else
    $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c $2 -b $3
fi
~
```
Next, you will need to create a systemd service file to manage the Keycloak service. You can copy the sample systemd service with the following command:
```bash
cp /opt/keycloak/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.service /etc/systemd/system/keycloak.service
```
Next, edit the keycloak.service file and define the Keycloak installation path:
```bash
vi /etc/systemd/system/keycloak.service
```
```bash
[Unit]
Description=The KeycloaK Server
After=syslog.target network.target
Before=httpd.service

[Service]
Environment=LAUNCH_JBOSS_IN_BACKGROUND=1
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
User=keycloak
Group=keycloak
LimitNOFILE=102642
PIDFile=/var/run/keycloak/keycloak.pid
ExecStart=/opt/keycloak/bin/launch.sh $WILDFLY_MODE $WILDFLY_CONFIG $WILDFLY_BIND
StandardOutput=null

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and close the file then reload the systemd daemon to apply the changes:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start keycloak
systemctl enable keycloak
systemctl status keycloak
```
At this point, the Keycloak server is started and listens on port 8080. You can check it with the following command:
```bash
ss -antpl | grep 8080
tail -f /opt/keycloak/standalone/log/server.log
```
### Create an Admin User for Keycloak

```bash

/opt/keycloak/bin/add-user-keycloak.sh -u admin
```
Set your password as shown below:
Next, restart the Keycloak service to apply the changes:
```bash
systemctl restart keycloak
```
Next, you will need to disable the HTTPS for Keycloak. You can disable it with the following command:
```bash
/opt/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://localhost:8080/auth --realm master --user admin
```
You will be asked to provide the admin password as shown below:
Next, run the following command to disable the HTTPS:
```bash
/opt/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=NONE
```
